The Vesica Trinexus is a geometric prototype created by Ramiro Franceschin based on a simple question: what happens if we take the Vesica piscis to its next three-dimensional octave?
<br>Instead of using the construction with two flat circles, two intersecting icosahedrons are used. This intersection generates the seed, the zero point of the construction. From there, the geometry expands into successive octaves.
<br>This work shows the polyhedral compositions that form the Vesica Trinexus, as well as some Vesica piscis constructions using polyhedrons, all modeled for viewing in Virtual Reality.

<h4>1. Vesica Trinexus: 1<sup>st</sup> octave</h4>
<a href="vr/trinexus1.htm" target="_blank" title="3D model" class="fotoA"><img src="ar/0A.png" class="foto" alt="Vesica Trinexus"></a>
 <br>Instead of using a construction with two flat circles, two intersecting icosahedrons are used to form the first stage of the Vesica Trinexus. This intersection of icosahedrons generates the seed, the zero point of the construction. From there, the geometry expands in successive octaves.
 <br>
<hr>
<h4>2. Vesica Trinexus: 2<sup>nd</sup> octave</h4>
<a href="vr/trinexus2.htm" target="_blank" title="3D model" class="fotoA"><img src="ar/1A.png" class="foto" alt="Vesica Trinexus"></a>
 <br>In the second octave of the Vesica Trinexus, truncated icosidodecahedrons appear, along with an equatorial belt of cubes. This arrangement resembles a system of 12 centers or chakras around a 13th central node, consistent with multiple symbolic traditions.
 <br>
<hr>
<h4>3. Vesica Trinexus: 3<sup>rd</sup> octave</h4>
<a href="vr/trinexus3.htm" target="_blank" title="3D model" class="fotoA"><img src="ar/2A.png" class="foto" alt="Vesica Trinexus"></a>
 <br>In the third octave of the Vesica Trinexus, antiprisms and pentagonal domes appear, resembling arrows that direct energy first toward the root and crown and finally back to the center. The pattern of these polyhedrons reveals a cycle of expansion and return.
 <br>
<hr>
<h4>4. Vesica Trinexus: 4<sup>th</sup> octave</h4>
<a href="vr/trinexus4.htm" target="_blank" title="3D model" class="fotoA"><img src="ar/3A.png" class="foto" alt="Vesica Trinexus"></a>
 <br>In the fourth octave of the Vesica Trinexus, antiprisms, pyramids, and pentagonal domes appear. The pattern of these polyhedrons reveals a cycle of expansion and return. The result is a geometry that:
<br>1. Integrates Platonic and Archimedean solids in harmonic progression;
<br>2. Suggests a three-dimensional energy system (12+1) that dialogues with traditions such as Kabbalah, Mayan symbolism, and the thought of Rudolf Steiner; and
<br>3. Shows how energy circulates in octaves: from the center to the poles and from the poles back to the center.
